Wappo is a "simple" puzzle game. You need to escape from an enemy, having taken cover in the house.

_Do you remember this game on old Siemens Mobiles?_

There are very few rules:
* The Player walks 1 square every turn, enemies - 2.
* Enemies always go straight to the Player by the shortest way.
* Enemies always try to make a horizontal step first, but if not possible, then they will make a vertical step.
